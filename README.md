I tell people I am a bioinformatician
In the past few months I have attendeda international level bioinformatics conference and have been working on a shiny app and my other resaerch project
Three most important strategies/tools I use for organizing my work: creating subdirectories with proper names with dates for ease of finding my files/scripts, creating proper documentation, and I organize my email by creating a folder with to-do list
